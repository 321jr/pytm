<p>
An adversary that has previously obtained unauthorized access to certain device resources, uses that access to obtain information such as location and network information.
</p>
<h6>
Mitigations
</h6>
<p>
Use strong authentication and authorization mechanisms. A proven protocol is OAuth 2.0, which enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an API.

<summary>Excavation</summary>
<h6>
Severity
</h6>
<p>
Medium
</p>
<h6>
Example Instances
</h6>
<p>
The adversary may collect this information through a variety of methods including active querying as well as passive observation. By exploiting weaknesses in the design or configuration of the target and its communications, an adversary is able to get the target to reveal more information than intended. Information retrieved may aid the adversary in making inferences about potential weaknesses, vulnerabilities, or techniques that assist the adversary’s objectives. This information may include details regarding the configuration or capabilities of the target, clues as to the timing or nature of activities, or otherwise sensitive information. Often this sort of attack is undertaken in preparation for some other type of attack, although the collection of information by itself may in some cases be the end goal of the adversary.
</p>
<h6>
Mitigations
</h6>
<p>
Minimize error/response output to only what is necessary for functional use or corrective language. Remove potentially sensitive information that is not necessary for the application’s functionality.

<summary>Double Encoding</summary>
<h6>
Severity
</h6>
<p>
Medium
</p>
<h6>
Example Instances
</h6>
<p>
Double Enconding Attacks can often be used to bypass Cross Site Scripting (XSS) detection and execute XSS attacks. The use of double encouding prevents the filter from working as intended and allows the XSS to bypass dectection. This can allow an adversary to execute malicious code.
</p>
<h6>
Mitigations
</h6>
<p>
Assume all input is malicious. Create a white list that defines all valid input to the software system based on the requirements specifications. Input that does not match against the white list should not be permitted to enter into the system. Test your decoding process against malicious input. Be aware of the threat of alternative method of data encoding and obfuscation technique such as IP address encoding. When client input is required from web-based forms, avoid using the GET method to submit data, as the method causes the form data to be appended to the URL and is easily manipulated. Instead, use the POST method whenever possible. Any security checks should occur after the data has been decoded and validated as correct data format. Do not repeat decoding process, if bad character are left after decoding process, treat the data as suspicious, and fail the validation process.Refer to the RFCs to safely decode URL. Regular expression can be used to match safe URL patterns. However, that may discard valid URL requests if the regular expression is too restrictive. There are tools to scan HTTP requests to the server for valid URL such as URLScan from Microsoft (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/urlscan.mspx).

<h6>
Example Instances
</h6>
<p>
Adversary tries to bring a network or service down by flooding it with large amounts of traffic.
</p>
<h6>
Mitigations
</h6>
<p>
Ensure that protocols have specific limits of scale configured. Specify expectations for capabilities and dictate which behaviors are acceptable when resource allocation reaches limits. Uniformly throttle all requests in order to make it more difficult to consume resources more quickly than they can again be freed.

<summary>Excessive Allocation</summary>
<h6>
Severity
</h6>
<p>
Medium
</p>
<h6>
Example Instances
</h6>
<p>
In an Integer Attack, the adversary could cause a variable that controls allocation for a request to hold an excessively large value. Excessive allocation of resources can render a service degraded or unavailable to legitimate users and can even lead to crashing of the target.
</p>
<h6>
Mitigations
</h6>
<p>
Limit the amount of resources that are accessible to unprivileged users. Assume all input is malicious. Consider all potentially relevant properties when validating input. Consider uniformly throttling all requests in order to make it more difficult to consume resources more quickly than they can again be freed. Use resource-limiting settings, if possible.

High
</p>
<h6>
Example Instances
</h6>
<p>
Untrusted search path vulnerability in the add_filename_to_string function in intl/gettext/loadmsgcat.c for Elinks 0.11.1 allows local users to cause Elinks to use an untrusted gettext message catalog (.po file) in a ../po directory, which can be leveraged to conduct format string attacks.
</p>
<h6>

<summary>LDAP Injection</summary>
<h6>
Severity
</h6>
<p>
High
</p>
<h6>
Example Instances
</h6>
<p>
PowerDNS before 2.9.18, when running with an LDAP backend, does not properly escape LDAP queries, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (failure to answer ldap questions) and possibly conduct an LDAP injection attack.
</p>
<h6>
Mitigations
</h6>
<p>
Strong input validation - All user-controllable input must be validated and filtered for illegal characters as well as LDAP content. Use of custom error pages - Attackers can glean information about the nature of queries from descriptive error messages. Input validation must be coupled with customized error pages that inform about an error without disclosing information about the LDAP or application.

<summary>Parameter Injection</summary>
<h6>
Severity
</h6>
<p>
Medium
</p>
<h6>
Example Instances
</h6>
<p>
The target application accepts a string as user input, fails to sanitize characters that have a special meaning in the parameter encoding, and inserts the user-supplied string in an encoding which is then processed.
</p>
<h6>
Mitigations

<summary>Relative Path Traversal</summary>
<h6>
Severity
</h6>
<p>
High
</p>
<h6>
Example Instances
</h6>
<p>
The attacker uses relative path traversal to access files in the application. This is an example of accessing user’s password file. http://www.example.com/getProfile.jsp?filename=../../../../etc/passwd However, the target application employs regular expressions to make sure no relative path sequences are being passed through the application to the web page. The application would replace all matches from this regex with the empty string. Then an attacker creates special payloads to bypass this filter: http://www.example.com/getProfile.jsp?filename=%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e /etc/passwd When the application gets this input string, it will be the desired vector by the attacker.
</p>
<h6>
Mitigations
</h6>
<p>
Design: Input validation. Assume that user inputs are malicious. Utilize strict type, character, and encoding enforcement. Implementation: Perform input validation for all remote content, including remote and user-generated content. Implementation: Validate user input by only accepting known good. Ensure all content that is delivered to client is sanitized against an acceptable content specification – whitelisting approach. Implementation: Prefer working without user input when using file system calls. Implementation: Use indirect references rather than actual file names. Implementation: Use possible permissions on file access when developing and deploying web applications.

<p>
An attacker finds a site which is vulnerable to HTML Injection. He sends a URL with malicious code injected in the URL to the user of the website(victim) via email or some other social networking site. User visits the page because the page is located within trusted domain. When the victim accesses the page, the injected HTML code is rendered and presented to the user asking for username and password. The username and password are both sent to the attacker’s server.

<h6>
Example Instances
</h6>
<p>
A target application has an integer variable for which only some integer values are expected by the application.

<summary>Dictionary-based Password Attack</summary>
<h6>
Severity
</h6>
<p>
High
</p>
<h6>
Example Instances
</h6>
<p>
A system user selects the word treacherous as their passwords believing that it would be very difficult to guess. The password-based dictionary attack is used to crack this password and gain access to the account.The Cisco LEAP challenge/response authentication mechanism uses passwords in a way that is susceptible to dictionary attacks, which makes it easier for remote attackers to gain privileges via brute force password guessing attacks. Cisco LEAP is a mutual authentication algorithm that supports dynamic derivation of session keys. With Cisco LEAP, mutual authentication relies on a shared secret, the user’s logon password (which is known by the client and the network), and is used to respond to challenges between the user and the Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) server. Methods exist for someone to write a tool to launch an offline dictionary attack on password-based authentications that leverage Microsoft MS-CHAP, such as Cisco LEAP. The tool leverages large password lists to efficiently launch offline dictionary attacks against LEAP user accounts, collected through passive sniffing or active techniques.See also: CVE-2003-1096
</p>
<h6>
Mitigations

<summary>XSS Targeting Non-Script Elements</summary>
<h6>
Severity
</h6>
<p>
Very High
</p>
<h6>
Example Instances
</h6>
<p>
An online discussion forum allows its members to post HTML-enabled messages, which can also include image tags. A malicious user embeds JavaScript in the IMG tags in his messages that gets executed within the victim’s browser whenever the victim reads these messages. <img src=javascript:alert('XSS')> When executed within the victim’s browser, the malicious script could accomplish a number of adversary objectives including stealing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, or cookies.
</p>
<h6>
Mitigations
</h6>
<p>
In addition to the traditional input fields, all other user controllable inputs, such as image tags within messages or the likes, must also be subjected to input validation. Such validation should ensure that content that can be potentially interpreted as script by the browser is appropriately filtered.All output displayed to clients must be properly escaped. Escaping ensures that the browser interprets special scripting characters literally and not as script to be executed.

High
</p>
<h6>
Example Instances
</h6>
<p>
Ajax applications enable rich functionality for browser based web applications. Applications like Google Maps deliver unprecedented ability to zoom in and out, scroll graphics, and change graphic presentation through Ajax. The security issues that an attacker may exploit in this instance are the relative lack of security features in JavaScript and the various browser’s implementation of JavaScript, these security gaps are what XSS and a host of other client side vulnerabilities are based on. While Ajax may not open up new security holes, per se, due to the conversational aspects between client and server of Ajax communication, attacks can be optimized. A single zoom in or zoom out on a graphic in an Ajax application may round trip to the server dozens of times. One of the first steps many attackers take is frequently footprinting an environment, this can include scanning local addresses like 192.<em>.</em>.* IP addresses, checking local directories, files, and settings for known vulnerabilities, and so on. <IMG SRC=javascript:alert('XSS')> The XSS script that is embedded in a given IMG tag can be manipulated to probe a different address on every click of the mouse or other motions that the Ajax application is aware of. In addition the enumerations allow for the attacker to nest sequential logic in the attacks. While Ajax applications do not open up brand new attack vectors, the existing attack vectors are more than adequate to execute attacks, and now these attacks can be optimized to sequentially execute and enumerate host environments.~/.bash_profile and ~/.bashrc are executed in a user’s context when a new shell opens or when a user logs in so that their environment is set correctly. ~/.bash_profile is executed for login shells and ~/.bashrc is executed for interactive non-login shells. This means that when a user logs in (via username and password) to the console (either locally or remotely via something like SSH), ~/.bash_profile is executed before the initial command prompt is returned to the user. After that, every time a new shell is opened, ~/.bashrc is executed. This allows users more fine grained control over when they want certain commands executed. These files are meant to be written to by the local user to configure their own environment; however, adversaries can also insert code into these files to gain persistence each time a user logs in or opens a new shell.

<summary>XSS Using Alternate Syntax</summary>
<h6>
Severity
</h6>

</p>
<h6>
Example Instances
</h6>
<p>
In this example, the attacker tries to get a script executed by the victim’s browser. The target application employs regular expressions to make sure no script is being passed through the application to the web page; such a regular expression could be ((?i)script), and the application would replace all matches by this regex by the empty string. An attacker will then create a special payload to bypass this filter: <scriscriptpt>alert(1)</scscriptript> when the applications gets this input string, it will replace all script (case insensitive) by the empty string and the resulting input will be the desired vector by the attacker. In this example, we assume that the application needs to write a particular string in a client-side JavaScript context (e.g.,
<script>HERE</script>
). For the attacker to execute the same payload as in the previous example, he would need to send alert(1) if there was no filtering. The application makes use of the following regular expression as filter ((w+)s<em>(.</em>)|alert|eval|function|document) and replaces all matches by the empty string. For example each occurrence of alert(), eval(), foo() or even the string alert would be stripped. An attacker will then create a special payload to bypass this filter: this<a href="1">‘al’ + ‘ert’</a> when the applications gets this input string, it won’t replace anything and this piece of JavaScript has exactly the same runtime meaning as alert(1). The attacker could also have used non-alphanumeric XSS vectors to bypass the filter; for example, (<span class="math inline"> = [</span>=[]][(__=!<span class="math inline">+</span>)[_=-<sub>-</sub>-~$]+({}+<span class="math inline">)[<sub>/<sub>]</sub></sub> + (</span><span class="math inline"> = (</span><em>=!’’+<span class="math inline">)[<sub>/<sub>]</sub></sub>+</span></em>[+$])])()<a href="_/_"><strong>[<em>/</em>]+</strong>[<em>+~<span class="math inline">]+</span></em>[_]+$$</a> would be executed by the JavaScript engine like alert(1) is.

<p>
In an Integer Attack, the adversary could cause a variable that controls allocation for a request to hold an excessively large value. Excessive allocation of resources can render a service degraded or unavailable to legitimate users and can even lead to crashing of the target.
</p>
<h6>
Mitigations
</h6>
<p>
Limit the amount of resources that are accessible to unprivileged users. Assume all input is malicious. Consider all potentially relevant properties when validating input. Consider uniformly throttling all requests in order to make it more difficult to consume resources more quickly than they can again be freed. Use resource-limiting settings, if possible.

<p>
Low
</p>
<h6>
Example Instances
</h6>
<p>
In 1997 the original DES challenge used distributed net computing to brute force the encryption key and decrypt the ciphertext to obtain the original plaintext. Each machine was given its own section of the key space to cover. The ciphertext was decrypted in 96 days.
</p>
<h6>
Mitigations
</h6>
<p>
Use commonly accepted algorithms and recommended key sizes. The key size used will depend on how important it is to keep the data confidential and for how long.In theory a brute force attack performing an exhaustive key space search will always succeed, so the goal is to have computational security. Moore’s law needs to be taken into account that suggests that computing resources double every eighteen months.

High
</p>
<h6>
Example Instances
</h6>
<p>
Untrusted search path vulnerability in the add_filename_to_string function in intl/gettext/loadmsgcat.c for Elinks 0.11.1 allows local users to cause Elinks to use an untrusted gettext message catalog (.po file) in a ../po directory, which can be leveraged to conduct format string attacks.
</p>
<h6>
Mitigations
</h6>
<p>
Limit the usage of formatting string functions. Strong input validation - All user-controllable input must be validated and filtered for illegal formatting characters.

<summary>Client-side Injection-induced Buffer Overflow</summary>
<h6>
Severity
</h6>
<p>
High
</p>
<h6>
Example Instances
</h6>
<p>
Attack Example: Buffer Overflow in Internet Explorer 4.0 Via EMBED Tag Authors often use &lt;EMBED/&gt; tags in HTML documents. For example </EMBED TYPE=audio/midi SRC=/path/file.mid AUTOSTART=true\|> If an attacker supplies an overly long path in the SRC= directive, the mshtml.dll component will suffer a buffer overflow. This is a standard example of content in a Web page being directed to exploit a faulty module in the system. There are potentially thousands of different ways data can propagate into a given system, thus these kinds of attacks will continue to be found in the wild.
</p>
<h6>
Mitigations
</h6>
<p>
The client software should not install untrusted code from a non-authenticated server. The client software should have the latest patches and should be audited for vulnerabilities before being used to communicate with potentially hostile servers. Perform input validation for length of buffer inputs. Use a language or compiler that performs automatic bounds checking. Use an abstraction library to abstract away risky APIs. Not a complete solution. Compiler-based canary mechanisms such as StackGuard, ProPolice and the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag. Unless this provides automatic bounds checking, it is not a complete solution. Ensure all buffer uses are consistently bounds-checked. Use OS-level preventative functionality. Not a complete solution.

<summary>Command Delimiters</summary>
<h6>
Severity
</h6>
<p>
High
</p>
<h6>
Example Instances
</h6>
<p>
By appending special characters, such as a semicolon or other commands that are executed by the target process, the attacker is able to execute a wide variety of malicious commands in the target process space, utilizing the target’s inherited permissions, against any resource the host has access to. The possibilities are vast including injection attacks against RDBMS (SQL Injection), directory servers (LDAP Injection), XML documents (XPath and XQuery Injection), and command line shells. In many injection attacks, the results are converted back to strings and displayed to the client process such as a web browser without tripping any security alarms, so the network firewall does not log any out of the ordinary behavior. LDAP servers house critical identity assets such as user, profile, password, and group information that is used to authenticate and authorize users. An attacker that can query the directory at will and execute custom commands against the directory server is literally working with the keys to the kingdom in many enterprises. When user, organizational units, and other directory objects are queried by building the query string directly from user input with no validation, or other conversion, then the attacker has the ability to use any LDAP commands to query, filter, list, and crawl against the LDAP server directly in the same manner as SQL injection gives the ability to the attacker to run SQL commands on the database.
</p>
<h6>
Mitigations
</h6>
<p>
Design: Perform whitelist validation against a positive specification for command length, type, and parameters.Design: Limit program privileges, so if commands circumvent program input validation or filter routines then commands do not running under a privileged accountImplementation: Perform input validation for all remote content.Implementation: Use type conversions such as JDBC prepared statements.

<p>
A target application has an integer variable for which only some integer values are expected by the application. But since it does not have any checks in place to validate the value of the input, the attacker is able to manipulate the targeted integer variable such that normal operations result in non-standard values.
